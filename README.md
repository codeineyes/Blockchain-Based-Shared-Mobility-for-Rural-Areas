# Blockchain-Based Shared Mobility for Rural Areas

A decentralized platform empowering rural communities to create efficient, sustainable transportation networks through shared vehicle ownership, coordinated ride scheduling, and transparent cost management.

## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of transportation access in rural areas by creating a blockchain-powered shared mobility system. By enabling communities to collectively manage vehicles, coordinate trips, share costs, and maintain their fleet, the platform provides an affordable, sustainable alternative to individual car ownership in regions underserved by public transportation.

The system uses smart contracts to create a transparent, trustless, and efficient framework for community mobility that adapts to the specific needs of rural areas.

## Core Components

### 1. Vehicle Registration Contract

Records and manages the shared vehicle fleet:
- Vehicle identification and specifications
- Ownership structure (individual, cooperative, or community-owned)
- Available usage hours and location
- Vehicle capabilities (passenger capacity, cargo space, accessibility features)
- Legal compliance and insurance verification

### 2. Ride Scheduling Contract

Coordinates community transportation needs:
- Trip booking and reservation system
- Route optimization for multiple stops
- Driver assignment and verification
- Schedule conflict resolution
- Regular route establishment for common destinations (medical facilities, shopping centers, etc.)

### 3. Cost Sharing Contract

Manages financial aspects of the shared mobility system:
- Usage-based cost allocation
- Fuel/energy expense tracking
- Driver compensation (when applicable)
- Subscription/membership management
- Payment processing and history

### 4. Maintenance Tracking Contract

Ensures vehicle reliability and safety:
- Usage-based maintenance scheduling
- Repair history and documentation
- Cost allocation for maintenance expenses
- Service provider verification
- Performance and efficiency monitoring

## Benefits

- **For Rural Residents**: Increases mobility access, reduces transportation costs, enables access to essential services, and creates community connection
- **For Communities**: Reduces total vehicle requirements, decreases environmental impact, builds community resilience, and improves local economic activity
- **For Local Governments**: Provides transportation alternatives without infrastructure investment, reduces road maintenance needs, and supports aging-in-place initiatives

## Technical Implementation

- Built on [specify blockchain platform]
- Smart contracts written in [programming language]
- GPS integration for location services
- Mobile-first design for accessibility
- Offline capabilities for areas with limited connectivity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List technical prerequisites]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rural-shared-mobility.git

# Install dependencies
cd rural-shared-mobility
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Configure your blockchain connection in `config.js`
2. Set up map integration and GPS services
3. Configure community-specific parameters

### Deployment
```bash
# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Community Vehicle
```javascript
// Example code for vehicle registration
const vehicleRegistry = await VehicleRegistry.deploy();
await vehicleRegistry.registerVehicle(
  "0x123...", // Vehicle owner address
  "Community Van", // Vehicle type
  "ABC123", // Vehicle identifier
  8, // Passenger capacity
  true, // Wheelchair accessible
  "ipfs://QmX..." // Documentation hash
);
```

### Scheduling a Trip
```javascript
// Example code for ride scheduling
const rideScheduler = await RideScheduler.deploy();
const tripId = await rideScheduler.scheduleTrip(
  departureLocation,
  destination,
  departureTime,
  returnTime,
  passengerCount,
  specialRequirements
);
```

## Rural-Specific Features

- **Low-connectivity operation**: Capable of operating with intermittent internet access
- **Multi-purpose trip planning**: Combines errands to maximize efficiency
- **Flexible scheduling**: Accommodates agricultural and seasonal work patterns
- **Essential service prioritization**: Medical appointments and grocery shopping receive higher priority
- **Community governance**: Democratic decision-making for system parameters

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial contract deployment and testing with pilot community
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile app development and user testing
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with existing rural transportation services
- **Q1 2026**: Expansion to multiple communities and inter-community transportation coordination

## Community Engagement

- Driver volunteer program
- Digital literacy training for seniors
- Community transportation coordinator roles
- Integration with local events and services
